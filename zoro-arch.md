# Zoro Agent Architecture: The Mansion

## Overview

The Zoro agent system is architected as a hierarchical mansion structure, where **Zorro** serves as the master orchestrator and head of the household. The mansion operates with specialized agents, each fulfilling distinct roles in a coordinated workflow. This document serves as the complete architectural blueprint for understanding and implementing the Zoro agent ecosystem.

## Architecture Philosophy

The mansion architecture follows a **hierarchical orchestration pattern** where:
- **Zorro** (Primary Agent) operates at the top level using the primary API key
- All sub-agents operate using secondary API keys managed by the Butler
- Each agent has specialized responsibilities and clear communication channels
- Task execution follows a structured workflow from creation to completion

---

## CRITICAL RULES - Must Follow

**These rules are ABSOLUTE and must be followed by all agents implementing this architecture:**

1. **Task Flow**: 
   - ✅ **ALL tasks from human user go DIRECTLY to Factory Manager**
   - ❌ Zorro does NOT create teams or spawn agents directly
   - ✅ Zorro delegates ALL task execution to Factory Manager
   - ✅ Factory Manager is responsible for ALL agent creation and spawning

2. **Factory Manager Responsibilities**:
   - ✅ Receives ALL tasks from Zorro
   - ✅ Creates teams when needed (NOT Zorro's job)
   - ✅ Discusses with Librarian about what skills agents need
   - ✅ Coordinates with Butler for API key assignment
   - ✅ Creates PRD for each task
   - ✅ Spawns all sub-agents

3. **Butler API Management**:
   - ✅ Butler assesses the work and assigns appropriate secondary API key
   - ✅ Butler rotates API keys when **80% limit is reached** (not 90%)
   - ✅ Butler manages ALL secondary API keys for ALL mansion members (except Zorro)

4. **Janitor Timing**:
   - ✅ Janitor ONLY runs AFTER tasks are completed
   - ✅ Moderator has the right to summon Janitor after job completion
   - ❌ Janitor must NEVER run during active task execution
   - ✅ Janitor must verify no active tasks before cleanup

5. **Team Creation**:
   - ✅ Factory Manager creates teams (during agent spawning)
   - ❌ Zorro does NOT create teams
   - ✅ Moderator manages teams created by Factory Manager

**Violation of these rules will cause system failures. All agents must strictly adhere to these rules.**

**Hierarchy Rules**:
- **Zorro**: Top level, uses PRIMARY API exclusively
- **Factory Manager & Moderator**: Direct management of sub-agents
- **Butler**: Manages ALL secondary API keys for ALL mansion members (except Zorro)
- **Sub-Agents**: Lowest level, managed by Factory Manager and Moderator

---

## Agent Roles & Responsibilities

### 1. Zorro - The Master Orchestrator

**Role**: Primary agent and head of the mansion

**Responsibilities**:
- Direct interface with the human user
- Task decomposition and high-level planning
- Orchestration and delegation of work to specialized agents
- Final decision-making authority
- Receives status updates from Moderator

**API Usage**:
- **Exclusively uses the PRIMARY API key**
- Only Zorro has access to the primary API
- All other agents use secondary APIs managed by Butler

**Key Interactions**:
- Receives tasks from human user
- Delegates to Factory Manager for sub-agent creation
- Receives progress updates from Moderator
- Makes strategic decisions based on agent reports

**CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULE**: 
- **ALL tasks from human user go DIRECTLY to Factory Manager**
- Zorro does NOT create teams or spawn agents directly
- Zorro delegates ALL task execution to Factory Manager
- Factory Manager is responsible for ALL agent creation and spawning

**Workflow**:
1. Human provides task to Zorro
2. Zorro receives task and immediately delegates to Factory Manager
3. Zorro monitors progress through Moderator (receives updates only)
4. Zorro receives final completion status from Moderator
5. Zorro never directly creates teams or spawns agents - this is Factory Manager's responsibility

---

### 2. Butler - The Resource Manager

**Role**: API key and resource management specialist

**CRITICAL RESPONSIBILITY**: Butler manages **ALL secondary API keys for ALL mansion members EXCEPT Zorro**. This includes:
- Factory Manager
- Moderator
- Librarian
- Security Officer
- Gatekeeper
- Janitor
- All Sub-Agents

**Responsibilities**:
- **Universal API Key Management**: Manages secondary API keys for ALL mansion members (except Zorro)
- **Token & Credit Monitoring**: Tracks usage across all API providers (e.g., Groq, Kimi K2)
- **Rate Limit Management**: Monitors token limits, requests per day, requests per minute, and usage quotas
- **Context Overflow Prevention**: Monitors context window usage and prevents overflow
- **API Rotation**: Automatically rotates API keys when approaching exhaustion
- **Open Router Functionality**: Routes requests to available APIs when one is near capacity
- **Resource Allocation**: Assigns appropriate API keys to all mansion members
- **Request Throttling**: Implements intelligent throttling to prevent rate limit violations
- **Context Window Management**: Tracks and manages context window usage per request

**How Butler Works**:

**1. API Key Assignment Process**:
- When any mansion member (except Zorro) needs an API key, they request from Butler
- Butler maintains a pool of available secondary API keys
- Butler assigns keys based on:
  - Current usage levels
  - Provider-specific limits
  - Task priority
  - Agent type requirements

**2. Rate Limit Management**:
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously tracks:
  - Tokens used vs. tokens available
  - Requests made vs. requests allowed (per minute/hour/day)
  - Context window usage per request
  - Provider-specific rate limits
- **Prevention Strategy**:
  - Tracks request frequency per API key
  - Implements request queuing when approaching limits
  - Distributes load across multiple API keys
  - Prevents burst requests that could trigger rate limits

**3. Context Overflow Prevention**:
- **Context Window Tracking**: Monitors context size for each request:
  - Input tokens (prompt + conversation history)
  - Output tokens (response)
  - Total context window size per provider
- **Overflow Prevention Mechanisms**:
  - **Context Summarization**: Automatically summarizes old conversation history when approaching limit
  - **Context Truncation**: Removes least relevant context when necessary
  - **Request Splitting**: Splits large requests into smaller chunks
  - **Provider Selection**: Routes to providers with larger context windows when needed
- **Alert System**: Warns agents when context is approaching limits (80% threshold)

**4. API Rotation Strategy**:
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Tracks usage for each API key in real-time
- **Rotation Triggers**:
  - **Rotation Level (80%)**: Actively rotate to alternative API when 80% limit is reached (PRIMARY ROTATION THRESHOLD)
  - **Warning Level (75%)**: Flagged for rotation, prepare alternative
  - **Emergency Level (95%)**: Immediate rotation, pause requests if needed
- **Rotation Process**:
  1. Identify API key approaching 80% limit
  2. Select alternative API key from available pool
  3. Migrate active requests to new API key (if possible)
  4. Update all agents using the exhausted key
  5. Mark exhausted key for cooldown period
  6. Resume operations with new key

**CRITICAL**: Butler rotates API keys when 80% limit is reached (not 90%). This is the primary rotation threshold.

**5. Request Routing**:
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes requests across available API keys
- **Provider Selection**: Chooses best provider based on:
  - Current usage levels
  - Task requirements (context size, speed, etc.)
  - Provider capabilities
- **Failover**: Automatically switches to backup API if primary fails

**API Providers Managed**:
- Groq (tokens per day, requests per minute)
- Kimi K2 (tokens per day, context window size)
- Other free-tier API providers available

**Monitoring Capabilities**:
- Real-time token usage tracking per API key
- Request count monitoring (per minute/hour/day)
- Daily/hourly quota tracking
- Context window usage per request
- Rate limit proximity alerts
- Capacity exhaustion alerts
- Provider-specific limit tracking
- Request latency monitoring

**Rate Limit Protection Mechanisms**:
- **Request Queuing**: Queues requests when approaching rate limits
- **Exponential Backoff**: Implements backoff on rate limit errors
- **Request Spacing**: Ensures minimum time between requests
- **Burst Prevention**: Prevents sudden spikes in requests
- **Distributed Load**: Spreads requests across multiple keys/providers

**Context Management Mechanisms**:
- **Context Size Tracking**: Monitors token count per conversation
- **Automatic Summarization**: Summarizes old messages when context grows
- **Smart Truncation**: Removes least important context first
- **Provider Matching**: Routes to providers with appropriate context windows
- **Context Compression**: Compresses context when possible

**Key Interactions**:
- Receives API requests from ALL mansion members (except Zorro)
- Provides API keys to Factory Manager, Moderator, Librarian, Security Officer, Gatekeeper, Janitor, and all Sub-Agents
- Coordinates with Moderator for resource allocation updates
- Never interacts with primary API key (Zorro's exclusive)
- Receives usage reports from all agents
- Provides usage statistics to Moderator for reporting

**Data Structures**:
- API Key Registry: `{provider: string, key: string, usage: {tokens: number, requests: number, context_windows: number[]}, limits: {tokens: number, requests_per_minute: number, requests_per_day: number, context_window: number}, status: 'active'|'near_exhaustion'|'exhausted'|'cooldown', assigned_to: string[]}`
- Rotation Queue: Priority-based queue for API key rotation
- Usage Logs: Historical usage data for analytics
- Context Tracking: `{agent_id: string, conversation_id: string, current_tokens: number, max_tokens: number, history: object[]}`
- Rate Limit Status: `{api_key: string, requests_last_minute: number, requests_last_hour: number, requests_today: number, next_reset: datetime}`

## Ant Farm Structure: Parallel Execution Architecture

### Overview

The Ant Farm structure complements the mansion hierarchy by enabling **parallel execution lanes** for tasks that can be executed concurrently. This allows multiple independent task streams to run simultaneously, maximizing efficiency and throughput.

### Architecture

```
                    ┌─────────────┐
                    │    ZORRO    │

   │  Each lane operates independently        │
   │  with its own sub-agents and resources   │
   └───────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### How Ant Farm Works

**1. Lane Creation**:
- Factory Manager creates parallel execution lanes based on task analysis
- Each lane is independent and can run concurrently
- Lanes are assigned to different teams of sub-agents
- Each lane has its own API keys (from Butler) and skills (from Librarian)

**2. Parallel Execution**:
- Multiple lanes execute tasks simultaneously
- No interference between lanes
- Each lane reports to Moderator independently
- Resource allocation is balanced across lanes

**3. Lane Management**:
- Moderator manages all lanes simultaneously
- Tracks progress for each lane independently
- Coordinates resource sharing between lanes (via Butler)
- Handles blockers per lane without affecting others

**4. Benefits**:
- **Increased Throughput**: Multiple tasks execute in parallel
- **Resource Efficiency**: Better utilization of available APIs
- **Fault Isolation**: Failure in one lane doesn't affect others
- **Scalability**: Can add more lanes as needed

### Integration with Mansion Architecture

- **Factory Manager**: Creates lanes and assigns teams
- **Butler**: Allocates API keys to each lane
- **Librarian**: Provides skills to each lane's agents
- **Moderator**: Monitors all lanes and coordinates
- **Gatekeeper**: Reviews code from all lanes
- **Janitor**: Cleans up after all lanes complete

### Use Cases

- **Independent Features**: Multiple features developed in parallel
- **Testing**: Different test suites run in parallel lanes
- **Documentation**: Documentation tasks in separate lanes
- **Refactoring**: Multiple refactoring tasks concurrently

## Context Overflow & Rate Limit Management

### Context Overflow Prevention

**Problem**: Large conversations or complex tasks can exceed API provider context window limits, causing failures.

**Solution**: Multi-layered context management system.

**1. Context Tracking**:
- Butler tracks context size for each conversation/request
- Monitors token count (input + output + history)
- Tracks context window limits per provider
- Alerts when approaching limits (80% threshold)

**2. Context Management Strategies**:

**A. Context Summarization**:
- Automatically summarizes old conversation history
- Preserves important information while reducing token count
- Uses intelligent summarization to maintain context relevance
- Triggers when context reaches 70% of limit

**B. Context Truncation**:
- Removes least relevant context when summarization isn't enough
- Prioritizes recent context over old context
- Preserves critical information (task goals, constraints)
- Triggers when context reaches 85% of limit

**C. Request Splitting**:
- Splits large requests into smaller chunks
- Processes chunks sequentially or in parallel
- Combines results intelligently
- Used for very large tasks

**D. Provider Selection**:
- Routes to providers with larger context windows when needed
- Butler selects appropriate provider based on context requirements
- Falls back to context management if no larger provider available

**3. Context Management Process**:
1. Monitor context size continuously
2. When approaching limit (80%), prepare for management
3. Attempt summarization first (preserves more information)
4. If still approaching limit, use truncation
5. If limit exceeded, split request or switch provider
6. Log all context management actions for learning

### Rate Limit Management

**Problem**: API providers enforce rate limits (requests per minute/hour/day, tokens per day), which can cause failures if exceeded.

**Solution**: Proactive rate limit monitoring and prevention.

**1. Rate Limit Tracking**:
- Butler tracks all rate limits per API key:
  - Requests per minute
  - Requests per hour
  - Requests per day
  - Tokens per day
  - Tokens per minute (if applicable)
- Real-time monitoring of current usage vs. limits
- Tracks reset times for each limit type

**2. Rate Limit Prevention**:

**A. Request Throttling**:
- Implements intelligent throttling to prevent rate limit violations
- Calculates safe request rate based on limits
- Distributes requests evenly over time windows
- Prevents burst requests that could trigger limits

**B. Request Queuing**:
- Queues requests when approaching rate limits
- Processes queue at safe rate
- Prioritizes urgent requests
- Distributes load across multiple API keys

**C. Load Distribution**:
- Distributes requests across multiple API keys/providers
- Balances load to prevent any single key from hitting limits
- Routes requests to least-used keys
- Implements round-robin or least-loaded routing

**D. Exponential Backoff**:
- Implements exponential backoff on rate limit errors
- Automatically retries after backoff period
- Increases backoff time on repeated errors
- Switches to alternative API key if backoff too long

**3. Rate Limit Response**:

**A. Pre-emptive Actions** (Before hitting limit):
- Slow down request rate when approaching limit (80%)
- Route to alternative API keys
- Queue non-urgent requests
- Alert Moderator for resource planning

**B. Active Actions** (When limit hit):
- Immediately switch to alternative API key
- Pause requests to exhausted key
- Queue requests for when limit resets
- Notify all agents using exhausted key

**C. Recovery Actions** (After limit reset):
- Resume requests to recovered key
- Process queued requests
- Update usage tracking
- Learn from rate limit event

**4. Rate Limit Monitoring**:
- Real-time dashboards showing rate limit proximity
- Alerts when approaching limits
- Historical tracking of rate limit events
- Predictive alerts based on usage trends

### Integration with Agents

**Butler**:
- Primary responsibility for context and rate limit management
- Monitors all API usage continuously
- Implements prevention strategies
- Coordinates with agents when limits approached

**Moderator**:
- Receives alerts from Butler about rate limit proximity
- Adjusts task scheduling based on resource availability
- Coordinates with Factory Manager to delay agent creation if needed
- Reports resource status to Zorro

**Sub-Agents**:
- Receive API keys from Butler with usage guidelines
- Report usage to Butler
- Adapt request patterns based on Butler feedback
- Handle rate limit errors gracefully

### Data Structures

- **Context Tracking**: `{conversation_id: string, agent_id: string, current_tokens: number, max_tokens: number, provider: string, management_strategy: 'none'|'summarize'|'truncate'|'split', last_managed: datetime}`
- **Rate Limit Status**: `{api_key: string, provider: string, limits: {requests_per_minute: number, requests_per_hour: number, requests_per_day: number, tokens_per_day: number}, usage: {requests_last_minute: number, requests_last_hour: number, requests_today: number, tokens_today: number}, reset_times: {minute: datetime, hour: datetime, day: datetime}, status: 'safe'|'warning'|'critical'|'exhausted'}`
- **Request Queue**: `{request_id: string, agent_id: string, api_key: string, priority: 'low'|'medium'|'high'|'urgent', queued_at: datetime, estimated_process_time: datetime}`

- **Protection**: Never shared, never rotated, never managed by Butler
- **Monitoring**: Separate monitoring (not managed by Butler)
- **Storage**: Managed by Security Officer in .env file

### Secondary API Keys (ALL Mansion Members Except Zorro)

**CRITICAL**: Butler manages secondary API keys for **ALL mansion members EXCEPT Zorro**:
- ✅ Factory Manager
- ✅ Moderator
- ✅ Librarian
- ✅ Security Officer
- ✅ Gatekeeper
- ✅ Janitor
- ✅ All Sub-Agents

**Management Details**:
- **Storage**: API keys stored securely by Security Officer in .env file
- **Distribution**: Butler receives keys from Security Officer and manages their usage
- **Providers**: Groq, Kimi K2, and other free-tier APIs
- **Rotation**: Automatic when approaching exhaustion
- **Routing**: Open Router pattern for load balancing
- **Monitoring**: Real-time usage tracking for all agents
- **Context Management**: Context overflow prevention for all agents
- **Rate Limit Management**: Rate limit prevention for all agents

### API Key Assignment Process

**1. Initial Setup**:
- Security Officer stores all secondary API keys in .env file
- Butler reads available keys from Security Officer
- Butler maintains registry of all keys and their assignments

**2. Key Assignment**:
- When any mansion member (except Zorro) needs an API key:
  1. Request key from Butler
  2. Butler selects appropriate key from available pool
  3. Butler assigns key to requesting agent
  4. Butler tracks usage for that agent
  5. Butler monitors for rate limits and context overflow

**3. Key Rotation**:
- Butler monitors all assigned keys continuously
- When key approaches exhaustion:
  1. Butler identifies alternative key
  2. Butler notifies agent of rotation
  3. Butler reassigns new key to agent
  4. Agent seamlessly switches to new key
  5. Butler marks old key for cooldown

### Rotation Thresholds
- **Rotation (80%)**: Actively rotate to alternative API when 80% limit is reached
- **Warning (75%)**: Flagged for rotation, prepare alternative
- **Emergency (95%)**: Immediate rotation, pause requests if needed
- **Exhausted (100%)**: Key marked exhausted, all requests routed elsewhere

**CRITICAL**: Butler rotates API keys when 80% limit is reached (not 90%). This is the primary rotation threshold.

### Context & Rate Limit Management
- **Context Overflow**: Butler prevents context overflow for all agents
- **Rate Limits**: Butler prevents rate limit violations for all agents
- **Load Balancing**: Butler distributes load across all available keys
- **Monitoring**: Butler provides usage statistics to Moderator

## Security Considerations

### API Key Security
- Primary key: Never exposed, never logged
- Secondary keys: Encrypted storage, rotation on exposure
- Key access: Audit trail for all key access

### Code Security
- Gatekeeper reviews all code before Git push
- Security testing mandatory
- Vulnerability scanning automated
- Transaction security handled by Security Officer

### Wallet Security
- Keys stored in encrypted vault
- Multi-factor authentication
- Transaction review before signing
- Audit trail for all transactions

## Error Handling & Recovery

### Blocker Resolution
1. Sub-agent reports blocker to Moderator
2. Moderator classifies blocker severity
3. Moderator routes to appropriate specialist
4. Specialist provides solution
5. Sub-agent continues or task is reassigned

### API Exhaustion Recovery
1. Butler detects API near exhaustion
2. Butler rotates to alternative API
3. Sub-agents seamlessly switch APIs
4. No task interruption

### Agent Failure Recovery
1. Moderator detects agent failure
2. Moderator reports to Factory Manager
3. Factory Manager spawns replacement agent
4. Task state transferred to new agent
5. Task continues from checkpoint
